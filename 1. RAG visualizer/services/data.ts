Tesla Model X Owner's Manual (Selected Excerpts)

Exterior Features
Model X has a unique panoramic windshield that provides a wide-open view. The falcon wing doors allow easy access to rear seats, even in tight parking spaces. To open a falcon wing door, press the handle or use the touchscreen. Sensors detect proximity to objects and adjust the opening arc to avoid contact. The front doors are equipped with automatic opening and closing features. As you approach Model X carrying a key, the driver's door automatically unlocks and opens.

Interior Features
The interior is designed for space and comfort. Model X offers seating for up to seven adults. The second-row seats are mounted on monopost supports, allowing for independent adjustment and ample legroom. The third-row seats fold flat into the floor to maximize cargo space. Premium engineered material is used throughout the cabin, which is more durable and stain-resistant than traditional leather.

Touchscreen
The 17-inch touchscreen is the main control center for Model X. It controls media, navigation, climate, and vehicle settings. You can customize the position of apps on the bottom bar. The touchscreen works like a tablet; pinch to zoom on maps and swipe to change menus. If the touchscreen is unresponsive, you can restart it by holding down both scroll buttons on the steering wheel until the Tesla 'T' logo appears.

Rear Touchscreen
Model X features a rear touchscreen located at the back of the center console. This screen allows rear passengers to control climate settings, seat heaters, and media volume. It can also stream video content while the vehicle is parked.

Interior Electronics and USB Ports
Model X has multiple USB ports. There are two USB-C ports in the front center console and two USB-C ports for rear passengers. These ports can charge devices and communicate with the vehicle for playing media files. A USB-A port is located inside the glovebox, which is recommended for saving Sentry Mode and Dashcam footage.

Instrument Panel
The instrument panel displays key driving information such as speed, range, and Autopilot status. The display creates a visualization of the road and detected objects, including other vehicles, pedestrians, and lane lines. Pay attention to the power meter; green indicates regenerative braking is feeding energy back into the battery, while black/white indicates power consumption.

Cameras
Model X is equipped with eight cameras that provide 360-degree visibility around the vehicle. These cameras support Autopilot features, Sentry Mode, and the Dashcam. The cabin camera is located above the rear-view mirror and monitors driver attentiveness when Autopilot is engaged. Ensure cameras are clean and free of obstructions for optimal performance.

Normal Operating Sounds
You may hear various sounds while operating Model X. A humming sound when parked is often the battery thermal management system cooling or heating the battery. A clicking sound from the floor area while charging is the high voltage contactors engaging. The air conditioning compressor may make a whirring noise that increases with fan speed. These are normal characteristics of an electric vehicle.

Voice Commands
You can use voice commands to control many features. Press the right scroll button on the steering wheel and say a command. Examples include "Navigate to home," "Set temperature to 70 degrees," "Open the glovebox," or "Play Beatles." Voice commands are designed to understand natural language.
